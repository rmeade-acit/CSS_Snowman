CSS Snowman Project
## Introduction
In this project, you will create a snowman using HTML and CSS! This project will help you practice important CSS concepts including positioning, shapes, gradients, and transforms. You'll learn how to break down a complex design into smaller components and use CSS properties to bring your snowman to life.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and apply CSS positioning (relative and absolute)
- Create shapes using CSS properties
- Use CSS transforms for rotation and positioning
- Implement CSS gradients and shadows for visual effects
- Practice organizing CSS code in a structured way

## Project Requirements
Your task is to create a snowman that includes the following elements:

1. Basic Structure
   - Three circular body segments (head, torso, base)
   - All segments should be properly sized and positioned
   - Use appropriate background colors and shading

2. Facial Features
   - Two round eyes
   - A triangular carrot nose
   - (Optional bonus: Add a smile using small dots or a curved line)

3. Accessories
   - A top hat with a ribbon (you choose the color)
   - A scarf (should appear to wrap around the neck)
   - Two branch arms with "finger" twigs
   
4. Styling
   - Use appropriate colors for each element
   - Add shadows or gradients for depth
   - Ensure proper positioning of all elements

## Technical Requirements
- Use only HTML and CSS (no images)
- Create the project in an HTML file with a linked CSS stylesheet
- Use appropriate CSS class names, and id's, that follow naming conventions
- Include comments in your code explaining major sections
- Ensure the snowman is centered on the page

| Proportions | Proportions are perfect and visually appealing | Proportions are appropriate | Proportions are slightly off | Proportions are significantly incorrect |

### Features and Details
| Criteria | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
|----------|---|---|---|---|
| Facial Features | Eyes and nose are perfectly positioned with excellent detail | Eyes and nose are properly positioned | Facial features need adjustment | Facial features are poorly executed |

| CSS Organization | CSS is meticulously organized with comprehensive comments and follows best practices | CSS is well-organized with appropriate comments | CSS organization needs improvement, comments are sparse | CSS is disorganized with no comments |
| Class and Id Naming | Class and Id names are highly intuitive, following BEM or similar methodology | Class and Id names are meaningful and follow conventions | Class and Id names are inconsistent or unclear | Class and Id names are confusing or inappropriate |
| Code Comments | Comments effectively explain code purpose, organization, and complex properties. Includes header documentation and section breaks. Comments enhance code readability. | Comments explain major sections and any complex CSS properties. Header ocumentation present. | Basic comments present but lack detail or missing for some sections. Header documentation may be incomplete. | Few or no comments present. No header documentation. Comments don't effectively explain code. |
